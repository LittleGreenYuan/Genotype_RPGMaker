# Genotype based on RPGMaker MV ace

Genotype is a board game from "Genius Games" Publishing in 2021. 

This board game is an in-depth look at genetics, recreating Mendel's genetic pea experiment. Game mechanics and genetics are seamlessly integrated, using dice to simulate the probability distribution of genetic laws, and to strategically modulate parental traits to influence offspring.


## Introduction
In this work, I used RPGMaker with a hybrid programming of event switches and scripts to reproduce part of the single-player game process in Genotype, including planting, seed acquisition, genotype acquisition, harvesting to calculate the score, and financial revenue. It is worth noting that some of the pea genotypes and helper links were removed to show the overall game flow.
